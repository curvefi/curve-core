# Curve Core

A minimal version of all curve infrastructure for AMM in one place.

## Structure

### AMM
- Stableswap - pools for 2 tokens with similar value (1~1)
- Twocrypto - pools for 2 different tokens
- Tricrypto - pools for USD-pegged coins combined with any coins

### Helpers
- Deposit and Stake Zap - for depositing and staking LPs in one tx
- Meta Zap - for easy exchange between LP and underlying tokens
- Router - router contract for executing complicated trades using different places


### Governance
- Agent and relayer for governance from mainnet DAO
- Vault for fee receiving from pools

### Gauge
- Reward-only gauge for incentives

### Registries
- Metaregistry for AMMs
- Address provider that has all address of factories/DAO/tokens:
    - 2: "Exchange Router"
    - 4: "Fee Distributor"
    - 7: "Metaregistry"
    - 11: "TricryptoNG Factory"
    - 12: "StableswapNG Factory"
    - 13: "TwocryptoNG Factory"
    - 18: "Spot Rate Provider"
    - 19: "CRV Token"
    - 20: "Gauge Factory"
    - 21: "Ownership Admin"
    - 22: "Parameter Admin"
    - 23: "Emergency Admin"
    - 24: "CurveDAO Vault"
    - 25: "crvUSD Token"
    - 26: "Deposit and Stake Zap"
    - 27: "Stableswap Meta Zap"

## Deployment

### Set up environment

#### Env file
Put settings file ("_env_") into [settings](/settings) directory.
[Example](/settings/env.example). It contains RPC url for target chain.

#### Set up Python environment

Project requires Python 3.11+

Install dependencies using poetry

```
pip install poetry==1.8.3
poetry install
```

#### Chain params file

Put settings file {chain_name}.yaml into [settings/chains](/settings/chains) directory.
[Example](/settings/chains/example.yaml). It will be used for deployment.

- **network_name** - chain name
- **chain_id** - chain id
- **rollup_type** - can be _op_stack_, _arb_orbit_, _polygon_cdk_, _zksync_ or "_". Zksync rollups currently aren't 
fully supported
- **native_wrapped_token** - address of native wrapped token (can be non-eth token)
- **dao** - params of contracts already present on chain (script will deploy x-gov contracts, CRV and crvUSD should 
be bridged using native bridges)

Integration parameters
- **layer** - chain layer (general info)
- **native_currency_symbol** - symbol of native token
- **native_currency_coingecko_id** - name of native token in coingecko (for fetching usd prices)
- **platform_coingecko_id** - coingecko chain name
- **public_rpc_url** - rpc used in UI (only public)

#### Deployment
Make sure you have funds at your account for gas at target chain.

- Export private key to env (don't store it in file!)
```
export DEPLOYER_EOA_PRIVATE_KEY={your key}
```
- Run deployment (replace chain_name with name of target chain you want to deploy - make sure you added chain config for
this chain in previous step!)
```
python manage.py deploy all {chain_name}
```

#### Deployment results
Upon success, script will generate deployment file with address and other info in [deployments](/deployments) directory.
File will have the same name as chain. ABI is stored in [abi](/abi) folder.
Deployments are reusable, so if something fails, it can be fixed and rerun.
**NOTE:** contracts should be verified separately on explorers like etherscan since it doesn't support Vyper contract 
verification by API.
